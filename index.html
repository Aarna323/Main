            <p>Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary. I love to do ballet. It is very graceful and requires lot of flexibility.It is done on soft tinkly piano music. Ballerinas wear tutus when performing ballet. I have a pink and green tutu. Ballet requires lot of technique.</p>
